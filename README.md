Installation
------------

Make sure you have [AWS-SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js/) installed and configured properly. Then install the Dynamit CLI to be used in your project with

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev dynoraptor
```

And then you should be able to run the CLI with

```bash
$ npx dynoraptor --help
```

Migration records are supposed to be stored in the DynamoDB table with the `table-name` (`"migrations"` by default) and primary key `attribute-name` (`"name"` by default) defined as optional cli options. The tool cannot create the table for you yet, so make sure you created it properly. See [Creating a Table Developer Guide](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithTables.Basics.html#WorkingWithTables.Basics.CreateTable)
